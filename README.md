# Notes on this assignment - Dojo

### Description(s)
In this assignment, you will be creating a StackOverflow / Quora clone. Users will be able to create questions, answers, and add tag subjects for the questions.

### Learning Objective(s)
* Create an entity that uses both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

### My notes / key take-aways / lingering questions
* Why does @NotBlank not import right away? 
	Not sure why, but the 'validation annotations' seem to only become available after trying to run the project for the first time
